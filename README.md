# reaper-scraper
Series and chapter scraper for reaperscans.com, a manga/manhwa/manhua scraper. Developed with BS4 in Python.

Simply input the link to the reaperscans.com series page to the prompt.
This will create a folder in the same directory, create a folder for the series, and add the cover image as a .jpg and the series information in a .txt file.
The chapters will also start downloading as .jpg files into separate folders.

Made this as a beginner to Python/BS4.
